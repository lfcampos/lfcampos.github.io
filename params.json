I then completed a Masters Degree in Statistics from <a href = 'http://statistics.berkeley.edu/'>U.C. Berkeley</a> in May 2012. After graduating I spent some time consulting in the San Francisco Bay area before taking on a position as a Statistician in the Biostatistics unit of the <a href = 'http://www.icts.uci.edu/services/berd.asp'>UC Irvine Institute for Clinical and Translational Sciences</a>.\r\n\r\nI'm currently a Graduate Student in Statistics at <a href = 'http://statistics.fas.harvard.edu/'>Harvard University</a>. I'm interested in broad applications of statistical principles and modeling to solve complex problems. Below you can find a list of past, current and future projects.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Teaching\r\nI've had the pleasure of assisting in teaching several semester-long courses, I'll list some here:\r\n\r\n- Introduction to Statistics - Statistics 21, U.C. Berkeley in Spring 2012\r\n- <a href = 'http://cs109.github.io/2015/'>Data Science</a> - Computer Science 109, Harvard University in Fall 2015 under <a href = 'http://www.people.fas.harvard.edu/~blitz/Site/Home.html'>Joe Blitzstein</a> and others\r\n- <a href = 'http://datasciencelabs.github.io/'>Introduction to Data Science</a> - Biostatistics 260, Harvard University in Spring 2016 under <a href = 'http://rafalab.dfci.harvard.edu/'>Rafael Irizarry</a> and Stephanie Hicks\r\n\r\n### Some people you should meet\r\nWorking on this.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Education\r\n\r\n- Ph.D. Statistics, Harvard University (**In Progress**)\r\n- M.A. Statistics, University of California, Berkeley, 2012\r\n- B.S.
